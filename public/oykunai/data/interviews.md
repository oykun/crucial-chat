## Adobe Blog: "Everything You Need to Build a Financial Services and Cryptocurrency App in Adobe XD" (April 2018)

**Featured For:** Creating the Cooin UI Kit for Adobe XD

### Key Highlights:

**About the Project:**
- Created **Cooin UI Kit** - a comprehensive, free UI kit for Adobe XD for financial services and cryptocurrency apps
- Kit includes flows for buying/selling digital currency, viewing currency values, creating wallets, and money transfers
- Contains common form elements, graphs, charts, light and dark themes
- Built using Adobe XD's shared colors, character styles, and symbols for easy customization

### Expert Design Insights Shared:

**On Designing for Cryptocurrencies:**
- "The word cryptocurrency may be heard by many people, but not everyone understands it. Because of this, people are inevitably confused and cautious"
- **"We, as designers, should design simple and familiar user experiences with clean and friendly user interfaces that make people feel comfortable and secure"**
- "It is important to simplify the experience and interface as much as possible, and help people easily engage with this new digital currency concept"

**On Designing Apps That Use Money:**
- **"It may sound cliche, but keep it simple"**
- "It is okay to go experimental with unusual animations for an entertainment app targeted primarily for young ages, but when it comes to dealing with money, it should be easy to understand and quick to use"
- **"Users should feel in complete control with the app"**
- "Apps that deal with money are used by everybody from every age, background, location, etc. Accessibility and simplicity play important roles"
- Use familiar/easy-to-read font families, keep things high contrast for good readability, keep UX simple with as few clicks required as possible

**On Designing Data Visualizations:**
- "Keep it simple by choosing the simplest way to show the data. Don't use over-complicated and unnecessary charts"
- **"Strive to be human and relatable. Instead of just delivering a number like 87, support it with a friendly message such as '87. That's 9 percent better than last week'"**
- "Make sure to use the right chart for the data"
- "Be careful with the colors you use; for example, don't use green for negative values. Follow common understandings of colors"
- "Add hierarchy to the data with font size, font weight, color, etc"

**On Designing Digital Wallets:**
- **"Make your users feel secure and 100 percent in control while using your application"**
- "Primary actions should be clear"
- "Use the right spacing and font size for your currency section since some currencies typically use more digits than others (for example, $100 vs. Â¥10,000)"

**On Designing for Payments and Money Transfers:**
- **"Create as few steps as possible to complete a transfer"**
- "In today's fast-moving world, people are impatient, and completing a money transfer should not take 10 steps"
- "Make use of technologies such as fingerprint scan and face scan on smartphones"
- "Make use of single digital currency codes and make sure they only need their email address to make a transfer"

**Bio Mentioned:**
- "Oykun Yilmaz is a London-based multidisciplinary designer with more than 15 years of experience"
- "He works on digital products from idea to prototype, design, and release phases"
- "Started his career as a full-stack developer, but a passion for digital and print media drew him to product design"
- "He's also the curator of design inspiration sites UIJar.com and MinimalStuff.com"
- "Oykun is still a hobbyist developer and a serial maker of side projects"
- **"At the heart of all his creations is a commitment to building digital products that prioritize simplicity and beauty"**

## MarvelApp: "Echo: Designing to Disrupt" (2016)

**Featured For:** UX Design work on Echo - NHS prescription app

### Project Overview:

**Echo - Revolutionary NHS Prescription App:**
- Free app that enables ordering repeat prescriptions from NHS GP
- Medication delivered to door by community pharmacy
- Incorporates reminders for when to take medication and when running out
- Addresses medication adherence - "between one third and half of all medications aren't taken properly" (UK Department of Health)

**My Role:** UX Designer working with CEO Sai Lashimi and CXO Stephen Bourke

### Key Insights from the Interview:

**What the CEO/CXO Said About Me:**
- **"We were introduced to our UX Designer Oykun by Murat, Marvel's founder, and he is truly special... he is one of the most talented designers that I've ever worked with"** - Stephen Bourke, CXO
- "He openly confesses that, when he first saw the project, he thought that it was going to be a lot easier than it was. He didn't immediately twig the sheer complexity of what we're doing"
- "In this industry, we cannot generalise. We're accountable for what we do"

**My Design Process for Echo:**

**1. Deep Research & Understanding:**
- **"The process started with dedicating time and attention to the mission of the business and the purpose of the product"**
- "This is so crucial because, as designers, people come to us to solve a problem. I'm not an expert in the medical industry so I had to start with research"
- "Understanding the business model of product and fully understanding how it works in real life plays huge role when starting a project"

**2. Collaborative Process:**
- Used Marvel for everything - "I don't use any other papers, tools or notepads for communication. Using multiple channels can get taxing as things can easily get lost"
- Wrote all feedback as comments in Marvel project
- Kept everything in grayscale initially - "no need to spend time on visuals whilst the flow is being established"
- Once flow approved, developers began backend using notes shared in Marvel project

**3. Design for Wide Demographic:**
- "In order to appeal to Echo's huge demographic, I had to consider the most effective colour scheme"
- "In the first version there were low contrast colours which some users had difficulty reading"
- **"For the older or visually impaired users, I reconsidered and introduced a high contrast colour scheme, added larger font types and bigger buttons"**

**4. On Design Inspiration:**
- **"When it comes to inspiration, I'm not someone who looks at Dribbble or Behance too much because I find that this can influence your work, sometimes unconsciously"**

**Project Impact:**
- Echo featured in Apple App Store, BBC, Wired
- Later acquired by Lloyds Pharmacy
- Addressed major NHS problem: medication adherence
