## On Being a Designer

Designers who work to live taking advice from successful designers who lived to work is one of the main problems we have in the advice space. Some people are naturally driven to work hard. And some don't. So when the driven person says just work uninterrupted 10 hours it's kind of useless because the other designer can't do that.

Experience is not so much about designing flashier pixels. Experience is about reliance, confidence, managing tough deadlines, creating value from design, etc… there is no way to share that on X feed.

Your X is more valuable than your Figma for your design career. Your network is more valuable than your portfolio.

Winning at design business is 80% who you are as a person, 20% design skills.

I got paid X when I used to design. I got paid 2x when I used to think and design. I get paid 3x+ when I think. "Think" as in make decisions, lead projects, close the gap between dev/design/pms, inspire people for the mission…

I'm not getting paid 3x+ $$$ and bonuses because I design the best looking button. I get paid 3x+ to make decisions, to create culture, to negotiate, to plan, to profit, to scale…

Going beyond Pixels as a designer is the Key to earning more with design.

## On AI & Design

We reached a point with LLMs that nobody cares about the benchmark numbers anymore. It's saturated, became meaningless. Now what separates is the experience. The speed, the number of tokens, the capability - they are all similar now. Six months ago, benchmarks did matter. Today what matters is the user experience.

Designing an AI product that deals with $3 soft transactions is surprisingly similar to designing a product that deals with hundreds of dollars.

UI is getting simpler, almost like disappearing. Give the example of simplified photos app in iOS. People have even less patience to deal with many buttons and dials in the UI. Now people are using ChatGPT and agents - we are in conversation, not buttons or inputs.

We used to interact with data via interfaces like buttons, forms, clicks. Now we can directly talk to AI. Design for that.

AI is going to replace tasks, not jobs.

Don't get too attached to prompt engineering structures. LLMs are evolving like crazy! It's not that we suck at using them, it's the case that they suck at helping us. It will only get better. These tools are designed by engineers! They are robotic, require precise engineer mindset, that's why you keep talking to it so specifically. Where we are is more like a proof of concept in tech. Now designers are taking their turn to humanify them.

## On Clients & Pricing

Don't sell design. Sell desired future.

Client doesn't pay for our designs, they pay for what design does to their business. They don't really care what it looks like - there's an infinite variations you could design that product after all. They run a business.

You can't just go and say "I need a website, how much does it cost?" -"I don't know, it depends, 10k, 50k, 100k+" (throw some big numbers). If they are not scared with the numbers, it's a good sign, they have money. If they go "wooooaaa! I have 1-2k" then you know what you are dealing with.

Designers, you need to charge more $$$. Not to stress yourself to deliver higher-quality work, but to enable you to deliver higher-quality work. The more $$$, the more time, focus, care you will have to invest, and it will have an impact in your outcome. So by charging more, you are not only helping yourself but your client as well.

Your price tells a lot about your offer - how confident you are in your solution, how high demand you are.

Don't take more clients for more money. Charge more from fewer clients.

Reinvent your service 1 client at a time. Increase your rate. Define your minimum $ and increase with every client.

How much would you invest on this if I were to take this back to office and come up with a strategy that will generate you $5 million a year?

## On Business Strategy

Too many designers want success before putting the work in for competence!

Be impatient with your inputs. Be patient with your outputs. Meaning work hard today, every day, without expecting quick results.

To have more, you have to become more.

Two, not three. You may want to try a new business, but you already have one. Now you have 2. Then you get a new idea! Sounds really simple! Now! You are asking yourself "Which one from the 2 I remove to bring the new one?!" You always have max 2! Focus.

Don't hire too early and split the pie! Bring complexity.

"As much money as possible" is not equal to "as many designs as possible"

The ultimate goal is to make business apart from me, not part of me.

Designers who solve design problems vs consultants who solve business problems.

3 ways to grow your business:
1. Increase the amount of clients
2. Increase the transactional value of clients  
3. Increase the frequency of clients purchasing from you again and again
Ideally have these all 3 at the same time.

## On Content & Social Media

Social media strategy is giving yourself to everyone else.

The question is not "what are you doing to find clients?" But "what are you doing for clients to find you?" You can only find so many clients by yourself! You need to create an interest in you! So people, businesses come to you!

Content! Post designs on X! Join Spaces! Record videos! Write articles! Case studies as proofs of your skill sets and results you produced!

It doesn't matter how good you are, unless people, businesses can't find you.

I need to reduce the time I spend on X yet increase the amount and quality of my posts.

Stop looking at results. Just design and share. Just write and share.

Why create content? To make potential clients say: I see you, I know you, I like you, I trust you, I want to work with you!

It's very different to know something vs leading a team doing the thing. You need to clearly articulate what you know.

## On Work & Career

Designers, stop saying "In my opinion…" You lose credibility straight away.

If you decide to be a design manager, you need to be okay with not being the most popular person as you possibly used to be.

The higher I get in my career, the fewer tasks I have on my Jira, yet the more I have to do.

Being a design lead is influencing without authority.

Being a Senior Designer is not so much about designing better, but having the ability to adapt and learn faster than Juniors.

You can't steer a stationary ship. Just get started, you will figure it out.

2 ways to get a promotion as a designer: Most go for "convincing to do the job" - telling that what they will do when they get the job. Few go for "showing to do the job" - they don't wait for the promotion to do the job, they proactively search what that promotion entails, they go and find opportunities to practice them. Then, when they come to the desk, they show what they do. That's why few people get the promotion.

You need to do the job before getting the promotion. That's how it works.

## On Success & Money

Designers, stop taking money as an indicator of success! Money ≠ Success. Define your own success!

Don't attach your happiness to $ numbers and you will never be happy.

I'm convinced 99% nonfiction books we read are not for new knowledge, they all are pretty common sense. What we are seeking is not knowledge, but an author who says it the way that resonates with us.

People don't become happy when they are rich, happy people become rich.

Too many designers think that they can run a successful design business just because they know how to design. That's why we see majority of designers earning 5 figures annually!

Nothing great is achieved by those who didn't deeply believe there is something special in them!

## On Personal Growth & Discipline

Fear gives bad advice.

Earning more money is not a good enough motivation to push forward. You need a big enough goal or reason to do the hard work.

Best morning routine is not about what you do, but what you do not do! Do not go on social media (you don't want to splash dirt that sticks around on your clean and fresh mind). Do not do simple design tasks (you don't waste your precious hours on repetitive, minor tasks). Do not check your emails.

Whatever was difficult, now easy. Your past defines your self image. Your self image defines what you think is possible.

Fear mediocrity more than failure!

You are a creative! Use your phone to create, not consume.

The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine.

Stop setting goals, start changing your lifestyle. You want to become the person whose default would be living that goal.

I want to do hard things in design! Hard is good. Hard is the thing no one else wants to do. Hard is what makes me valuable. Hard things take long. Most give up. You won't be in the competitive field. Once you do the hard thing, you will have that badge for life. Then onto the next hard thing! Don't let hard scare you but motivate you!

## On Learning & Growth

Growth mindset is basically saying Yes to most things and figure it out how to deliver along the way.

You either win or you learn.

I get more clarity in 20 mins by doing the thing than spending 40 mins thinking about the thing. Do the f*cking thing!

Designers don't study design. Study your category. Focusing on AI, study AI. Focusing on real estate, study the real estate market.

Go and play with the new tools. Just have fun. Do not stress about making money, completing a project. Just explore and have fun.

Designers tend to learn and then design. Better to design to learn.

While you're listening, reading, watching content, you need to take at least 1 note. If there is nothing you can take, you are consuming the wrong thing or the easy thing.

Knowing and not doing is like not knowing. Stop consuming. Start applying what you learn. Less consumption, more implementation.

## On Focus & Productivity

Productivity is not about getting more things done, but getting fewer better things done. Eliminate, prioritise.

Complexity is the enemy of execution. Just do! Keep it simple and do. Put in reps!

Focus is not having some magic techniques to concentrate at the task in hand. It simply is, lack of distraction! Set up your env accordingly.

How to get more done: Proper scheduling by longer periods with fewer switches. You get more done with uninterrupted 2 hours for writing than 6 hours of interrupted writing/designing/reading… Less context switching! No interruptions! Time block if you need to.

Think less, Design more. Think more, Design less.

Elimination > prioritisation > organisation. You can tackle anything in life.

## On Relationships & Communication

Framework: I know you, I like you, I trust you. That's it! Unfold these 3, become the person who accumulates these attributes and you will never have difficulty with finding high value clients or job offers. Rules for life really. Apply to friendship, leadership, building your own products…

Smart people with good intentions and good energy. Don't let them go!

People want to do business with people they know, like and trust. So, you need to network, be human and competent.

Selling is teaching. Teaching design, teaching how to be a good client, teaching what good design looks like, teaching how design impacts business…

Relationship first marketing. Don't talk about pricing or sales. First build the relation. Provide some value (fixing something small for them for free). Then show them how they can pay you.

## On Life Philosophy

Imagine a future where we get paid tokens instead of dollars. You can use your tokens to ask useless shit like what a celebrity is doing similar to how you may be spending your money today for useless junk. Versus using your tokens to generate business ideas to make money similar to how you would invest your money to build your business today.

1. We used to read books that took days
2. Then we started watching movies that took hours
3. Then we started watching YouTube videos that took minutes
4. Today we are watching shorts that take seconds

And wonder why we can't focus, why we can't stay on a task for hours, why we can't be consistent with what matters… Want to get better? Want to fix your focus? Want to fix your brain? Want to improve your attention? Reverse the order! Read books! 📚

If you are waiting for new year to change your life, your business, you have already lost.

Death by a thousand cuts.

The less you want them, the more they want you. It's like dating.

Starting a business is hard at first but easy later. Working for someone is easy at first, hard later. So do the hard thing first.

## Random Thoughts & Observations

There is something meditative with design when you know exactly what you need to do and how it should be done. You put your headset, play music, and just design! Damn! Does that not feel good?!

Failure often comes from forcing your current self to do something that you are not meant for! You need to become a new person whose standard is doing that!

I miss the days I was young and dumb. Chasing anything and everything blindly with no consideration or logic or conveniences… Pure heart led life in design.

Too have more, you have to become more.

To those getting wealthy QUIETLY.

Curiosity as pursuing mastery.

I have noticed how unintentionally portfolio websites and CV designs get simpler look to them as you advance in your career. I remember my earlier CVs, over designed PDFs with colours, shapes. Today, it's a text on white doc. It's almost that juniors try to compensate for experience with design while seniors are over it.

Looking at my notes from years. It's amazing to see how much I disagree with most :) We grow, we learn, we change… Don't be stubbornly stuck!

It's amazing how selfless we become as a Designer and human being as we get older. I want to share more now. Share the project. Share the learning. Share the connection. Money. Career…

I have never titled myself as Junior Designer, even when I first started. I have always been "Designer". Wording matters!

## On the Industry

Level of bad advice that can cause long term harm to designers from "creditable" large accounts is terrifying! For example, they encourage spamming to build connections. Playing the number game. It's like throwing a dynamite to a lake to catch a fish and hoping 1 would survive for you to eat! Instead, you should carefully fish for the big one. Build relationships.

Too many "solo-preneurs" and freelancers talk shit about 9-5 jobs and their unlimited income possibility with no bound to salary range. Yet they are working 10+ hours a day, 7 days a week, earning 5 digits. While full timers work 7-8 hours a day with normal pace 5 a week, taking 6-7 weeks holiday plus bank holidays, earning multiple 6 figures.

Design subscription services are gonna be the first to be replaced with AI. No personality. No human relation. Just producing design like a robot.

All design studio websites started to look the same like from a template. No personality! Which makes money the only differentiator. Landing on one, not caring about anything but scrolling all the way down to the pricing section to make a decision. I don't like what it represents for design!

## On Confidence & Self-Worth

Confidence is domain specific. You can be a confident designer in logo but not in negotiation.

Don't link your confidence to your abilities. There is always someone better at designing, animating, coding than you… Link to your intentions. Link to your purpose.

Lack of confidence comes from lack of knowledge. Educate yourself. Know your numbers before you start negotiating your rate or salary.

Walk like you own the place! Literally, with shoulders back, chin up, slow steps! Look people in the eye as you walk past! Make your presence felt! But with a warm smile, not a smug face. Confidence vs arrogance.

Confident or Arrogant. There is a thin line there. Be careful where you stand.

## On Taking Action

You know what makes you replaceable! Just say it! Nothing that special about visual design skills. So many designers out there are creating amazing designs. A company, client could easily replace you with someone cheaper! What they can't replace is YOU - your communication, your care, your your energy… Go beyond pixels and make yourself irreplaceable!

Don't say you will do something. Say you did something.

Too often, we open our hands to sky and wish things would happen. Too rarely, put the same hands on the task long enough to make our wish happen.

I wish wishes come true by wishing. You gotta work for it!

Nothing is impossible, it just takes work! Get to work Oykun!

Ability to decide and choose over creating as a skill.

Take your own advice.

Your 2024 is Not-Quitting! Do not quit! Then you can not not-success!

## On Future & Vision

I have been thinking a lot about the future I want. I'm 41 now and what is the life I want at the age of 45. I should start working on that today. I'm mature enough to know that good and sustainable things in life take time. I have been a kind of fire in me for a while, starting a completely new lifestyle despite having a pretty comfortable one I have now. A new life full of new challenges.

I'm reverse engineering my future. I want to have a life of AM free, PM for people. So I need to be free from clients.

My journey as a designer:
- 10s-20s-30s: doing more  
- 30s-40s: doing less but better
