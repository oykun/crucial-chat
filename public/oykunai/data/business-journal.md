## Current Business Philosophy (2025)

### Speed in AI Design (October 5, 2025)
**Key Insights:**
- **"In the age of AI, speed is everything!"** - Products, features we design evolve overnight
- **"The window between idea, design and development is shorter than ever"** - If your design process can't keep up, you won't be able to contribute to AI innovations
- **"Moving fast doesn't mean lowering the standards"** - It doesn't mean not-caring for the details
- **"Speed is not about rushing! Speed is about intent and focus!"** - Focus on what truly matters: perception, usability, clarity, trust
- **"I design fast because the AI world move fast"** - And we slow down only to perfect what truly matters
- **"Adopting this mindset has played a big role in the success of the products I've designed with AI founders"**

### Building Together Philosophy (September 21, 2025)
**What I Believe In:**
- **"Creating together, not churning out assets"** - Quality over quantity
- **"Working side by side, in the same room or digitally"** - Collaboration is key
- **"Shared vision, not one-sided briefs"** - Partnership approach
- **"Conversations, not design tickets"** - Human connection matters
- **"Craft and care, not just speed"** - Excellence in execution
- **"The best design happens when we 'build together'"**

**What I Don't Believe In:**
- Growing the design team by hiring mindlessly
- Templitising design solutions for speedy execution
- Removing client meetings to save time
- Sacrificing the human connection and quality for speed
- Prioritizing revenue over quality design

1. **"Every project is an opportunity to do better, to be better"**
2. **"Money is a byproduct of care and excellence"**
3. **"High-quality input leads to high-quality output"**
4. **"Keep it simple, say more with less"**
5. **"Treat every project as your own, every client as partner"**
6. **"Focus on what truly matters to move fast"**

### AI-First Design Approach (September 16, 2025)
**Philosophy:**
- **"Mobile-first design"** → **"AI-first design"**
- Understanding that AI products require different design approaches
- Designing for intelligent systems, not just interfaces

## Journal Philosophy & Approach

### Authentic Behind-the-Scenes (September 9, 2025)
**What This Journal Is:**
- **"There's a human behind the designs you see at Crucial.Design"** - That's me, Öykün, with feelings, aspirations, struggles, and dreams
- **"Not everything I do makes it into a polished case study"** - Some ideas are half-formed, some are random explorations
- **"Behind-the-scenes updates, feelings, moments, sketches, screenshots, photos, links, and notes"**
- **"It won't always be pretty. Sometimes it'll be useful, sometimes just fun or personal. Either way, it'll be honest"**

**Purpose:**
- Show the human side of design work
- Share unfiltered thoughts and process
- Connect with clients and community on a personal level
- Document the journey, not just the outcomes
