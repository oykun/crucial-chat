## Design Philosophy Insights

### Psychology Over Aesthetics
Design is fundamentally about understanding human psychology, not just making things look pretty. Every interface decision should be based on how people actually think and behave.

### Knowing When Not to Design
Sometimes the best design decision is to remove something, not add it. Over-designing is a common mistake that leads to confusion and poor user experience.

### AI Design is Different
Designing for AI products requires understanding how people interact with intelligent systems. It's not just about buttons and layouts - it's about trust, expectations, and mental models.

### Creative Direction
Being a creative director isn't about being the most creative person in the room. It's about having the courage to make decisions and provide clear direction when others are uncertain.

### Thoughtful vs. Endless Iteration
Good design comes from thoughtful decisions, not endless tweaking. Know when to stop iterating and move forward with confidence.
