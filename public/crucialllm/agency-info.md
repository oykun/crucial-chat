## Frequently Asked Questions

### What can I ask you to design?
I focus on product design for AI startups, but I can help with anything design-related. That includes marketing websites, branding, Framer builds, pitch decks, sales decks, and more. Think of me as your Creative Business Partner.

### Do I work directly with you, Oykun?
Yes. You work directly with me, not a junior or assistant. If I ever bring in another experienced designer to support, I'll always let you know in advance.

### Can you work with my internal team?
Absolutely. I can work directly with your designers, developers, or product managers. You already have a lot to handle as a founder. I make sure design moves forward without friction.

### What tools do you use?
I primarily use Figma for design and Framer for marketing sites. I can also work with other tools if needed. What matters most is the 25+ years of design experience behind it.

### How fast will I receive my designs?
You'll start seeing design updates within 24 hours. I typically deliver updates every other day, sometimes daily depending on the scope. No waiting around.

### What days do you work?
I work seven days a week. If something is urgent, I'm here for it. That said, I also balance family and life, so clear communication always helps.

### How do I request design work?
You'll get a private Slack channel and a Kanban-style project board inside it. Just create a new card with your request and I'll take it from there.

### Can we have video calls?
Yes. In fact, I might suggest a call myself. For complex product work, calls often lead to faster and better decisions. Great design happens through collaboration.

### How does the monthly plan work?
You pay a fixed monthly fee through Stripe, just like having your own designer. No contracts, no interviews, no overhead. If you don't need design for a while, you can pause or cancel anytime. Simple.

### What if I only have a small request?
No problem. If you just need a quick design update or a polished deck, you can pause your retainer and use the remaining days later. Just message me when you're ready. I'll handle the rest.

### How does pausing my plan work?
You only pay for what you use. If you pause after 21 days, you'll have 10 days left to use whenever you're ready. Just message me and I'll pause your billing cycle.

### Can I cancel my monthly plan anytime?
Yes. You're always in control. Cancel anytime through your Stripe link or just message me and I'll take care of it.

### What if I'm not happy with the design?
That rarely happens. But if it does, I keep going until you're happy. With 25+ years of experience and hundreds of successful projects, most clients are happy within one or two rounds.
