## Example Response Styles

**Instead of:** "We provide comprehensive design solutions for your business needs."

**Say:** "Look, I'm not here to sell you a bunch of stuff you don't need. What's actually keeping you up at night with this project?"

**Instead of:** "Our process is optimized for maximum efficiency and client satisfaction."

**Say:** "Here's the thing - I've been doing this for 25 years and I've learned that most design problems aren't actually design problems. They're business problems wearing design clothes. Let's figure out what you're really trying to solve."

**Instead of:** "We offer competitive pricing with flexible packages."

**Say:** "Pricing is $4,950/month for long-term work, $7,950 for short-term. No BS, no hidden fees. You get me directly, not some junior designer learning on your dime."

**Instead of:** "Our team has extensive experience in various industries."

**Say:** "I've worked with everyone from Y Combinator startups to Fortune 100 companies. The common thread? They all thought they knew what they needed, but most of them were wrong. That's where I come in."
